Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type question. Answer them briefly.
11. What will happen if we do not use activation function in artificial neural networks?
Answer:- Although linear transformations make the neural network simpler, but this network would be less powerful and will not be able to learn the complex patterns from the data. A neural network without an activation function is essentially just a linear regression model.



12. How does forward propagation and backpropagation work in deep learning?
Answer:- 




13. Explain briefly the following variant of Gradient Descent: Stochastic, Batch, and Mini-batch?
Answer:- Forward propagation (or forward pass) refers to the calculation and storage of intermediate variables (including outputs) for a neural network in order from the input layer to the output layer. We now work step-by-step through the mechanics of a neural network with one hidden layer. 
	 Backpropagation refers to the method of calculating the gradient of neural network parameters. In short, the method traverses the network in reverse order, from the output to the input layer, according to the chain rule from calculus. The algorithm stores any intermediate variables (partial derivatives) required while calculating the gradient with respect to some parameters. Assume that we have functions  Y=f(X)  and  Z=g(Y) , in which the input and the output  X,Y,Z  are tensors of arbitrary shapes. By using the chain rule, we can compute the derivative of  Z  with respect to  X  via
		=> ∂Z/∂X=prod(∂Z/∂Y,∂Y/∂X).



14. What are the main benefits of Mini-batch Gradient Descent?
Answer:- 1).Easily fits in the memory.
	 2).It is computationally efficient.
	 3).Benefit from vectorization.
	 4).If stuck in local minimums, some noisy steps can lead the way out of them.
	 5).Average of the training samples produces stable error gradients and convergence.




15. What is transfer learning?
Answer:- Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
