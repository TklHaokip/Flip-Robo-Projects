Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
11. Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.
Answer:-  Python programme to find the factorial of a number provided by the userÂ¶

# To take input from the user
number =int(input('enter the number :'))
factorial = 1

# Check if the number is positive,negative or zero
if number < 0:
    print('sorry, the factorial does not exist for negative numbers')
elif number == 0:
    print('The factorial of 0 is 1')
else:
    for i in range(1,number+1):
        factorial = factorial*i
    print('The factorial of',number,'is',factorial)





12. Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.
Answer:- Python program to check if the input number is prime or not


#Take input from the user
num = int(input("Please enter the number: "))
#Check if the given number is greater than 1
if num > 1:
   # Iterate through 2 to num/2.
    for i in range(2,num//2):
      #Select if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and num/2.
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num,"is not a prime number")
            print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
            break
    else:
         #If given number is not fully divisible by any number between 1 and num/2, then its prime.
        print(num,"is a prime number")
# Also, if the number is less than 1, its also not a prime number.
else:
    print(num,"is not a prime number")





13. Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
Answer:- ALGORITHM:
	 Step1: Enter string as an input.
	Step2: Using string slicing we reverse the string and compare it back to the original string.
	Step3: Then display the result
 
# CODE
my_string=input("Enter string:")
if(my_string==my_string[::-1]):
   print("The string is a palindrome")
else:
   print("The string isn't a palindrome")




14. Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides.
Answer:- Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides

def pythagoras(opposite_side,adjacent_side,hypotenuse):
        if opposite_side == str("x"):
            return ("Opposite = " + str(((hypotenuse**2) - (adjacent_side**2))**0.5))
        elif adjacent_side == str("x"):
            return ("Adjacent = " + str(((hypotenuse**2) - (opposite_side**2))**0.5))
        elif hypotenuse == str("x"):
            return ("Hypotenuse = " + str(((opposite_side**2) + (adjacent_side**2))**0.5))
        else:
            return "You know the answer!"
    
print(pythagoras(3,4,'x'))
print(pythagoras(3,'x',5))
print(pythagoras('x',4,5))
print(pythagoras(3,4,5))




15. Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.
Answer:- # Python3 code to demonstrate each occurrence frequency using naive method  
  
# initializing string  
test_str = "GeeksforGeeks"
  
# using naive method to get count of each element in string  
all_freq = {} 
  
for i in test_str: 
    if i in all_freq: 
        all_freq[i] += 1
    else: 
        all_freq[i] = 1
  # printing result  
print ("Count of all characters in GeeksforGeeks is :\n "
                                        +  str(all_freq))
