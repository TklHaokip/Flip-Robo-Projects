Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer:- A set is also a collection of objects but it is unordered and doesn't allow duplicates. Very similar to the mathematical concept of a set. Sets are also mutable. A tuple is like a list with one difference that tuples are immutable. Immutability allows them to be used in places where lists can't be (keys of dictionaries).





12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô
with space in python.
Answer:-  No strings are immutable in Python. x = x[:place] + replacement + x[place+1:]




13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.
Answer:-## https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ord-function-python/##
Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string. For example, ord(‚Äòa‚Äô) returns the integer 97, ord(‚Äò‚Ç¨‚Äô) (Euro sign) returns 8364. This is the inverse of chr() for 8-bit strings and of unichr() for unicode objects. If a unicode argument is given and Python was built with UCS2 Unicode, then the character‚Äôs code point must be in the range [0..65535] inclusive.
If the string length is more then one, and a TypeError will be raised.

The syntax can be ord(‚Äúa‚Äù) or ord(‚Äòa‚Äô), both will give same results.
# inbuilt function return an  
# integer representing the Unicode code 
value = ord("A") 
  
# writing in ' ' gives the same result 
value1 = ord('A') 
  
# prints the unicode value 
print value, value1
Output:
65 65

Exceptions
1. TypeError : Raised when string length is more than 1.

# inbuilt function return an  
# integer representing the Unicode code 
# demonstrating exception 
  
# Raises Exception 
value1 = ord('AB') 
  
# prints the unicode value 
print (value1) 




Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ùëéùë•
2 + ùëèùë• + ùëê = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‚Äòa‚Äô should not be equal to 0.
Answer:- ## From https://www.javatpoint.com/python-quadratic-equation##
# import complex math module  
import cmath  
a = float(input('Enter a: '))  
b = float(input('Enter b: '))  
c = float(input('Enter c: '))  
  
# calculating the discriminant  
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)  
  
# find two solutions  
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)  
print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))   




15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‚Äòn‚Äô natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‚Äòn‚Äô.
Answer:- ## From https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-numbers/ ##
# PYTHON program to find sum of first 'n' natural numbers. 
# Below codes Returns sum of first n natural numbers 
def findSum(n) : 
    sum = 0
    x = 1
    while x <=n : 
        sum = sum + x 
        x = x + 1
    return sum
  
# Driver code 
  
n = float(input('Enter the value of n :'))
print (findSum(n))
