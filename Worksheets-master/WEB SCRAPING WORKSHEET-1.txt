Q13.What are static and dynamic web pages?
Answer:-Static Website:
A static website includes a series of HTML and CSS files where each HTML file represents a web page of the website. In static sites, the format and number of pages are fixed which offers fixed information to the client. Even though two webpages of the site consist of same content such as header or footer, both webpages would have two different versions of the same. So, in order to make changes in the header or footer section, you need to make the changes in both the files manually.
This is how sites were created in the early days of the internet.

Dynamic website:
Dynamic websites use server technologies to create web page dynamically when someone visits the page. When a user visits a certain web address, the server looks into the bunch of variety of pieces of information to write a single united webpage which is then displayed to the user. In a nutshell, dynamic websites can change the webpage dynamically while the user is accessing the page on the browser. Server-side programming (JSP, ASP.net, PHP) is used to change page’s content at run time.
